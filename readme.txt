Allows Coming Soon or Custom Status text instead of normal pricing for downloads in Easy Digital Downloads.

== Description ==

This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads"). It allows downloads to be "Coming Soon" or have Custom Status text, and prevents them from being added to the cart. It does a few things:

1. Adds a checkbox to the download configuration so you can set the download to Coming Soon / Custom Status.
1. Adds a text field to the download configuration so you can set the text to show (default "Coming Soon").
1. Adds "Coming Soon" or your custom status text underneath the price on the admin pricing column
1. Displays "Coming Soon" or the Custom Status text instead of the price when using the [downloads] shortcode, and anywhere else where the edd_price() function has been called.
1. Prevents the coming soon download from being purchased. The plugin will remove the purchase button and stop the download from being added to cart via the edd_action. Eg ?edd_action=add_to_cart&download_id=XXX
1. Allows customers to vote on a specific download. A download's votes are listed on the edit/publish page and on the admin dashboard

** Filter examples **

	    return 'Not long now!';
    }
    add_filter( 'edd_cs_coming_soon_text', 'edd_coming_soon_modify_default_status_text' );


Example filter of how you can modify the markup of the coming soon text in the admin columns. Copy this function to your functions.php

	    return __( 'This item cannot be purchased just yet, hang tight!', 'edd-coming-soon' );

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm not seeing the "Coming Soon" text on my download grid =

Some themes may have coded their own custom solution for displaying the downloads. Try switching to the default WordPress theme to see if you can see the text.

= I'm still seeing a price on my single download page =

It depends on how your theme displays the price on your single download page. If your theme uses the default EDD purchase form then this will be removed fine. However some themes might have their own function for displaying the price so you'll need to edit your theme to remove it. You can use the following condition to wrap blocks of code that shouldn't be displayed such as the price:

    <?php if ( ! edd_coming_soon_is_active() ) : ?>
         // the code you don't want to show when a download is set to coming soon
    <?php endif; ?>

= I don't want to show the coming soon text after the content on the single download page, how can I remove it? =

Add the following to your functions.php

    remove_filter( 'the_content', 'edd_coming_soon_single_download' );
