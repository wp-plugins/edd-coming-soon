Allows Coming Soon or Custom Status text instead of normal pricing for downloads in Easy Digital Downloads.

== Description ==

This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads"). It allows downloads to be "Coming Soon" or have Custom Status text, and prevents them from being added to the cart. It does a few things:

1. Adds a checkbox to the download configuration so you can set the download to Coming Soon / Custom Status.
1. Adds a text field to the download configuration so you can set the text to show (default "Coming Soon").
1. Replaces the download's price in the pricing admin column with "Coming Soon" or the Custom Status text.
1. Displays "Coming Soon" or the Custom Status text instead of the price when using the [downloads] shortcode, and anywhere else where the edd_price() function has been called.
1. Prevents the coming soon download from being purchased. The plugin will remove the purchase button and stop the download from being added to cart via the edd_action. Eg ?edd_action=add_to_cart&download_id=XXX
